## 📝 About The Project
This is my first project to practice **Dynamic Memory** and **Pointer Arithmetic** in C++.

The main challenge I set for myself: **Do not use Array Indexing (`a[i]`)** in logic functions. All manipulation must be done using pointers (e.g., `*(p+i)`).

## 🚀 Features
1.  **Dynamic Input:** User inputs size `n` (using `new` operator).
2.  **Show Data:** Print array using pointer traversal.
3.  **Filter Primes:** Find prime numbers and show their memory address.
4.  **Reverse Array:** Reverse using Two Pointers technique.
5.  **Sort Array:** Bubble sort using pointers.
6.  **Search Number:** Count occurrences and find indices.

## 🤝 Community Feedback
I am a first-year student and new to C++.
Since I wrote this code quickly after learning, there might be bugs or memory issues.
**Please review my code and give me feedback/advice to improve!**

Thank you!
